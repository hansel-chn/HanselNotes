## 怎么绕过了age的间隙锁，不是已经锁定大于20的记录了？

绕过 `age` 的间隙锁（Gap Lock）通常是因为以下原因之一：

### 1. **插入操作使用了不同的索引**

InnoDB 的锁是基于索引的。如果插入操作使用了唯一索引（如主键 `id`），而间隙锁是基于非唯一索引（如 `age`），那么间隙锁不会阻止插入操作。例如：

- 查询 `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 20 FOR UPDATE` 会在 `age` 索引上加间隙锁。
- 插入 `INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (101, 'Alice', 25)` 使用的是主键 `id` 索引，因此不会被 `age` 索引的间隙锁阻止。

### 2. **事务隔离级别不是 REPEATABLE READ**

间隙锁只在 **REPEATABLE READ** 隔离级别下生效。如果事务隔离级别是 **READ COMMITTED**，InnoDB
不会使用间隙锁，而是只锁定具体的行。这种情况下，插入操作不会被阻止。

### 3. **查询范围未覆盖插入的记录**

如果查询范围未完全覆盖插入的记录，间隙锁可能未锁定插入位置。例如：

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > 20 FOR UPDATE;
```

- 如果表中没有 `age > 20` 的记录，InnoDB 可能只锁定了 `age` 索引的末尾间隙。
- 插入 `age = 25` 的记录可能未被锁定的间隙覆盖，因此插入成功。

### 4. **插入操作是由当前事务执行**

如果插入操作和查询操作在同一个事务中，InnoDB 不会阻止自己事务的插入操作。

### 如何避免绕过间隙锁

1. **确保查询范围覆盖所有可能的插入位置**：
    - 如果需要锁定所有 `age > 20` 的间隙，可以确保表中有一条记录满足条件，或者使用更明确的范围查询。

2. **使用主键或唯一索引加锁**：
    - 在查询时同时锁定主键或唯一索引，避免插入操作绕过非唯一索引的间隙锁。

3. **验证事务隔离级别**：
    - 确保事务隔离级别为 **REPEATABLE READ**，以启用间隙锁。

4. **明确锁定范围**：
    - 使用 `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` 或 `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` 明确锁定需要保护的范围。

### 示例

确保间隙锁生效的查询：

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > 20 FOR UPDATE;
-- 确保锁定所有 age > 20 的间隙
```

## If another transaction inserts a new row (e.g., age = 25) and commits, the new row is not part of the original snapshot. However, if the first transaction re-executes the query without locking, it may see the new row, causing a phantom read. 为什么，是因为范围查询和单挑查询逻辑不一样？没有用到mvcc机制？为什么可见

The reason why the new row becomes visible in a **range query** but not in a **single-row query** lies in the way *
*MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)** and **locking mechanisms** handle these scenarios.

### Key Points:

1. **MVCC Mechanism**:
    - MVCC ensures that each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database as of the transaction's start time.
    - For **single-row queries**, MVCC uses the row's version information (transaction IDs) to determine visibility. If
      a row was inserted or modified after the transaction's snapshot was taken, it will not be visible to the current
      transaction.
    - For **range queries**, MVCC also ensures consistency for rows that existed at the time of the snapshot. However, *
      *new rows inserted into the range after the snapshot** are not inherently excluded unless additional locking is
      applied.

2. **Range Queries and Phantom Reads**:
    - A **range query** (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 20`) does not lock the "gaps" between rows unless
      explicitly requested (e.g., using `FOR UPDATE` or `LOCK IN SHARE MODE`).
    - If another transaction inserts a new row (e.g., `age = 25`) and commits, this row is not part of the original
      snapshot. However, when the first transaction re-executes the range query, it evaluates the condition (`age > 20`)
      again, and the new row matches the condition, making it visible.

3. **Why Single-Row Queries Are Different**:
    - A **single-row query** (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1`) directly targets a specific row. MVCC ensures
      that only the version of the row visible at the time of the snapshot is returned.
    - Since no new rows can match the query condition (as the row's identity is fixed), phantom reads do not occur in
      single-row queries.

4. **Gap Locking in Range Queries**:
    - To prevent phantom reads in range queries, **gap locks** are required. These locks explicitly block the insertion
      of new rows into the range.
    - Without gap locks, the range query does not prevent other transactions from inserting rows that match the query
      condition.

### Example:

```sql
-- Transaction 1
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > 20;
-- Reads rows with age = 25, 30

-- Transaction 2
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO users (id, age)
VALUES (3, 28); -- Inserts a new row
COMMIT;

-- Transaction 1
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > 20; -- Now sees rows with age = 25, 28, 30 (phantom read)
COMMIT;
```

### Why the New Row is Visible:

- The **range query** evaluates the condition (`age > 20`) dynamically each time it is executed.
- Without gap locks, the new row (`age = 28`) is not excluded by MVCC because it matches the query condition and is
  committed.

To avoid this, you must explicitly lock the range using `FOR UPDATE` or use the `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level.

## mysql 可重复读和读已提交在更新数据时加的锁一样吗

Yes, RabbitMQ's publish/subscribe model can lead to additional memory usage due to message duplication. Here's why:

1. **Message Duplication in Queues**:
    - When a message is published to an exchange (e.g., a `fanout` exchange), it is routed to all bound queues.
    - Each queue stores its own copy of the message until it is consumed by a subscriber.
    - This means that if a message is routed to multiple queues, RabbitMQ will store multiple copies of the message in
      memory or on disk (depending on the queue's configuration).

2. **Impact on Memory**:
    - The more queues a message is routed to, the more memory (or disk space) RabbitMQ will use to store the message.
    - This can increase memory usage significantly in scenarios with many queues or high message throughput.

3. **Mitigation**:
    - Use efficient queue bindings to minimize unnecessary message routing.
    - Enable message expiration (`x-message-ttl`) to automatically remove messages from queues after a certain time.
    - Use disk-backed queues for large-scale systems to reduce memory pressure.

In summary, RabbitMQ does not share a single message instance across multiple queues; instead, it creates separate
copies for each queue, which can lead to additional memory usage.

## mysql slow queries

A large number of slow queries in a database can lead to several issues, including:

### 1. **Increased Latency**

- Slow queries consume significant resources, causing delays in processing other queries.
- This can lead to higher response times for applications relying on the database.

### 2. **High CPU Usage**

- Complex or unoptimized queries can cause the database server's CPU usage to spike, reducing overall performance.

### 3. **High Disk I/O**

- Slow queries often involve large table scans or excessive reads/writes, leading to increased disk I/O.
- This can degrade performance for other operations requiring disk access.

### 4. **Lock Contention**

- Slow queries may hold locks on tables or rows for extended periods, causing contention and blocking other queries.

### 5. **Memory Usage**

- Slow queries may consume a large amount of memory for sorting, joining, or caching intermediate results, potentially
  leading to memory exhaustion.

### 6. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**

- If slow queries occupy database connections for too long, the connection pool may be exhausted, preventing new queries
  from being executed.

### 7. **Deadlocks**

- Slow queries can increase the likelihood of deadlocks, especially in high-concurrency environments.

### 8. **Increased Query Timeout Errors**

- Applications may experience query timeouts if slow queries prevent timely execution of other requests.

### 9. **Degraded User Experience**

- End users may experience delays or errors in applications due to the database's inability to handle requests
  efficiently.

### 10. **Potential System Crashes**

- Prolonged resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, or disk) caused by slow queries can lead to database server crashes.

To mitigate these issues, consider:

- Optimizing slow queries (e.g., adding indexes, rewriting queries).
- Monitoring and analyzing slow query logs.
- Scaling the database (e.g., sharding, replication).
- Using caching mechanisms to reduce database load.

## mysql一般每秒可以支持多少查询，单机配置

The number of queries per second (QPS) that a MySQL database can handle on a single machine depends on several factors,
including hardware resources, query complexity, and MySQL configuration. Below are the key considerations:

### 1. **Hardware Resources**

- **CPU**: More cores allow better parallel query execution. Modern multi-core CPUs can handle thousands of queries per
  second.
- **Memory**: Sufficient memory is required for caching and query execution. For example:
    - 8 GB RAM: Suitable for small workloads.
    - 16-32 GB RAM: Suitable for medium to large workloads.
- **Disk I/O**: High-performance SSDs are recommended for handling high read/write operations.

### 2. **Query Complexity**

- **Simple Queries**: Key-value lookups or indexed queries can handle tens of thousands of QPS.
- **Complex Queries**: Joins, aggregations, or unindexed queries significantly reduce QPS.

### 3. **MySQL Configuration**

- **`innodb_buffer_pool_size`**: Set to 70-80% of available memory for optimal InnoDB performance.
- **`query_cache_size`**: Use caching for frequently accessed data (or external caching like Redis).
- **`max_connections`**: Ensure sufficient connections are allowed for concurrent queries.

### 4. **Workload Type**

- **Read-Heavy Workloads**: Can achieve higher QPS with proper indexing and caching.
- **Write-Heavy Workloads**: Limited by disk I/O and transaction overhead.

### 5. **Practical Estimates**

- **Small Server (4 cores, 8 GB RAM)**: ~5,000-10,000 QPS for simple queries.
- **Medium Server (8 cores, 32 GB RAM)**: ~20,000-50,000 QPS for simple queries.
- **Large Server (16+ cores, 64+ GB RAM)**: ~100,000+ QPS for simple queries.

### 6. **Load Testing**

To determine the exact QPS for your setup, perform load testing using tools like `sysbench` or `JMeter`.

### Example: `sysbench` Command for Load Testing

```bash
sysbench --db-driver=mysql --mysql-host=127.0.0.1 --mysql-user=root --mysql-password=your_password \
--mysql-db=test --threads=16 --time=60 --report-interval=10 oltp_read_only run
```

This will simulate a read-only workload and provide QPS metrics for your MySQL instance.
