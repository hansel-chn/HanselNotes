## Thundering herd

Yes, this does not involve the "thundering herd" problem. The "thundering herd" issue occurs when multiple processes are
woken up to handle the same event, leading to unnecessary resource contention. In the scenario you described, the issue
arises because the kernel randomly assigns the event to one process, and once that process handles the event, the other
processes do not need to process it again. This is by design and avoids redundant processing. If multiple processes
truly need to handle the same data, mechanisms like shared memory, message queues, or explicit task distribution (e.g.,
via a master process) can be used to ensure all processes receive and process the required data.
